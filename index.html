A flourishing metropolis, it has preserved its essence in the form of music, dance and literature. The presence of beautiful buildings, museums, eateries, markets, temples, churches, fort, and theatres makes Kolkata a place where a visitor would always feel that they are short of time.

                The history of Calcutta goes back to two millennia when Kalkata was only a small fishing village. The remains of the old villages and settlements are still found all around the banks of Hooghly River. The city’s recorded history started in the year 1690 when East India Company arrived and started operating from here. Before them, Calcutta State was a subsidiary of the Mughals. The presence of Hooghly river provided an easy commute for inland water transport and during this time, Kolkata was nothing but a collection of three villages that used the river as a source of their livelihood.
